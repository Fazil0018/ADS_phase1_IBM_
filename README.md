# Future Sales Prediction Project

## Project Overview

The "Future Sales Prediction" project aims to develop a predictive model for a retail company to forecast future sales based on historical sales data. The project's primary goal is to assist the company in optimizing inventory management and making informed business decisions. By analyzing past sales trends and relevant factors influencing sales, we can leverage data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict future sales accurately.

## Problem Statement

The challenge is to create a predictive model that effectively navigates uncertainties and unexpected variables that can influence sales trends. The accuracy of future sales prediction significantly impacts inventory management, resource allocation, and overall business success. The project revolves around striking a balance between data-driven insights and an understanding of dynamic market conditions, consumer behavior, and external influences.

## Data Source

We used the "Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2022" dataset from Kaggle as our primary data source.



## Tools and Software Used

In this project, we employed various tools and software to perform data analysis, build models, and create visualizations:

1. *Programming Language:* Python, with libraries like Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn for data analysis and machine learning.
2. *IDE:* Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or PyCharm for coding and running machine learning experiments.
3. *Machine Learning Libraries:* Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models, and TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning.
4. *Data Visualization Tools:* Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data exploration and visualization.
5. *Data Preprocessing Tools:* Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and preprocessing.
6. *Data Collection and Storage:* Depending on the data source, web scraping tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup or Scrapy) or databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) were used for data storage.
7. *Version Control:* Git for tracking changes in the code.
8. *Notebooks and Documentation:* Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown for creating README files and documentation.

## Project Phases

### 1. Design Thinking and Present in Form of Document

In this phase, we followed the design thinking process, which includes:

- Empathize: Understand the retail company's pain points and objectives.
- Define: Clearly define the problem statement and key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Ideate: Brainstorm potential solutions and approaches with a cross-functional team.
- Prototype: Create a small-scale prototype to test the feasibility of the chosen approach.
- Test: Evaluate the model using a validation dataset.
- Implement: Develop a full-scale solution with data pipelines, model training, and a user interface.
- Feedback and Iterate: Continuously collect feedback and monitor the system's performance.
- Scale and Optimize: Consider scaling the system and optimizing efficiency.
- Educate and Train: Provide training to relevant staff members.
- Celebrate Success: Acknowledge and celebrate project successes.

### 2. Design into Innovation

This phase involved critical steps like data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, model selection, model training, and evaluation. 

### 3. Feature Engineering

We created sequences of data for training our models. This phase included normalizing data, creating input features and targets, determining the look-back period for the LSTM model.

### 4. Feature Selection

We selected relevant features for sales prediction based on correlation analysis, feature importance, and domain knowledge.

### 5. Model Selection

Based on the problem complexity and data characteristics, we considered models like linear regression, ARIMA, and machine learning methods (random forests, gradient boosting).

### 6. Model Training

The LSTM model was trained for top-selling book sales prediction, including data preprocessing, splitting into training and testing sets, model building, compilation, and training.

### 7. Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated the model using regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) score. Lower MAE, MSE, and RMSE and higher R² indicate better model performance.

## Code Examples

We provided code snippets to demonstrate key project tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Make sure to replace the dataset file paths and target variables with your specific data.

## Results

We shared the outcomes of model training and evaluation, including loss metrics and visualizations to compare actual and predicted values.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project underlines the significance of selecting appropriate models, understanding the influence of relevant features, and maintaining a balance between accuracy and interpretability. By integrating domain knowledge and refining models iteratively, we can achieve optimal sales forecasting results.
